# Concesionario Django Project

Welcome to the **Concesionario Django Project**! This web application, developed as part of the ITEC RÃ­o Cuarto program, is designed to manage a car dealership. The project explores the full capabilities of Django using the Model-Template-View (MTV) architecture.

**Please note that this project is currently in development and is not intended for production use.** It serves as a course assignment, with the primary goal of showcasing Django's features in a controlled environment.

## Key Features

- **App Structure**: The project is organized into four main Django apps: `Vehicles`, `Comments`, `Users`, and `Media`, each handling different aspects of the application.
- **No JavaScript**: The project is built purely using Django's Model-Template-View architecture with Python and HTML, without any JavaScript.
- **Image Management**: Images are stored with unique filenames generated using UUIDs to avoid conflicts and ensure consistency.
- **Admin Capabilities**: Admin users have full management capabilities, including uploading and managing images through both the frontend interface and the Django admin backend.
- **User Roles**: The application supports different user roles, each with varying permissions.
- **User Registration and Authentication**: Secure user registration, login, and logout processes.
- **Vehicle Management**: Admins can add, update, and delete vehicles, and upload images.
- **Commenting System**: Users can leave comments on vehicles, with admins and moderators managing these comments.
- **Vehicle Following**: Users can follow specific vehicles and view them in their profiles.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: In the admin panel, vehicles can be filtered by various criteria such as brand, price, and year of manufacture.
- **Context Processors**: Custom context processors dynamically inject user status into templates.
